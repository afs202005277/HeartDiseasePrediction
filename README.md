# Heart Disease Prediction with Supervised Learning

This repository contains the code and documentation for IART's second practical assignment, which focuses on applying machine learning models to predict heart disease. The objective is to analyze the dataset, implement multiple supervised learning algorithms, and evaluate their performance using a range of metrics.

## Overview

Heart disease remains a significant global health challenge. This project applies supervised learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease. A comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to assess class distribution, feature values, and potential data quality issues. Following data preprocessing, several classification algorithms are implemented and rigorously evaluated.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Examine class distributions, attribute statistics, and other key characteristics.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
  - Address missing values, outliers, and normalize data as required to ensure the dataset is suitable for modeling.

### 2. Model Implementation & Training
- **Algorithm Selection:**
  - Implement at least three supervised classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines.
- **Parameter Tuning:**
  - Optimize model parameters to enhance predictive performance.
  
### 3. Evaluation & Analysis
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Evaluate models using confusion matrices, precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 scores.
- **Efficiency Assessment:**
  - Compare the training and testing times of the models.
- **Visualization:**
  - Present results through detailed tables and plots using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python 3.x:** The primary programming language.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For building and evaluating machine learning models.
